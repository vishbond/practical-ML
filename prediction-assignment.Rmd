Data Cleaning

To clean the data, the first row index and all colomuns with NA were removed. The traing and testing data were saved as traing2.csv and testing2.csv.

# Remove everything in current working library
rm(list = ls())
# Read cleaned training and testing data 
training <- read.table(file = "pml-training2.csv", 
                       header = TRUE, sep = ",", quote = "")
testing <- read.table(file = "pml-testing2.csv", 
                      header = TRUE, sep = ",", quote = "")
# Change the numeric type to integer type to make sure 
# the same data type in training data and testing data
training$magnet_dumbbell_z <- as.integer(training$magnet_dumbbell_z)
training$magnet_forearm_y <- as.integer(training$magnet_forearm_y)
training$magnet_forearm_z <- as.integer(training$magnet_forearm_z)
# Change the 
levels(testing$new_window) <- levels(training$new_window)
Exploratory Data Analysis

Cross Validation was performed to find the out of sample errors.

# Install randomForest package

Exploratory Data Analysis

set.seed(111)
# Define cross-validation experiment

# Perform the cross validation

  trControl = fitControl)

cv
Build random forest model with full training model

Bete Tune of number of variable randomly sampled is: r cv$bestTune$mtry

RandomForest = randomForest(classe ~ ., data = training, 
                            mtry = cv$bestTune$mtry)
PredictForTrain = predict(RandomForest)
table(PredictForTrain, training$classe)
Predict testing data

PredictForest = predict(RandomForest, newdata = testing)
PredictForest
Write the Prediction to files

# Function to write a vector to files
pml_write_files = function(x){
  n = length(x)
  for(i in 1:n){
    filename = paste0("problem_id_", i ,".txt")
    write.table(x[i], file = filename, quote = FALSE,
                row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
  }
}
# Call the function
pml_write_files(PredictForest)
